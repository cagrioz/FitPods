# FitPods
An android app that tests the fitting of AirPods Pro's.

## About FitPods
I've started FitPods to make Android users able to test the fitting their AirPods Pro's. Altough I've completed the UI design structure, I could not build the testing functionality. In addition, if we implement the functionality that also shows the battery percentage of the AirPods Pro's this app would be quite useful for AirPods users.

**What I've implemented so far:**
- Navigation between the screens with stack navigation
- Audio effect while the testing starts
- Custom Google Fonts and some icons
- UI design and components

## How Can You Test The App?
- Download the repo.
```
npm install
npm start
```
After you run these commands expo tab will be opened into your browser. You can either view the app via an Emulator (Android Studio) or just download the app called Expo to your phone. After you download the Expo app into your phone just scan the QR code that in the opened tab. Then, you'll be able to view the app.
