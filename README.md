# FitPods
An android app that tests the fitting of AirPods Pro's.

## About FitPods
I've started FitPods to make Android users able to test the fitting their AirPods Pro's. Altough I've completed the UI design structure, I could not build the testing functionality. In addition, if we implement the functionality that also shows the battery percentage of the AirPods Pro's this app would be quite useful for AirPods users.

**What I've implemented so far:**
- Navigation between the screens with stack navigation
- Audio effect while the testing starts
- Custom Google Fonts and some icons
- UI design and components

## Compatibility
Compatible with React Native 0.62.2
